	# ANIMATION

	Examples:

	## Animations don't need a starting point, such as a hover. They just begin as soon as the page is loaded.

		@include animation-name(scale, slide);
		@include animation-duration(2s);
		@include animation-timing-function(ease);
		@include animation-iteration-count(infinite);

		// Animation shorthand works the same as the CSS3 animation shorthand
		@include animation(scale 1.0s ease-in, slide 2.0s ease);

		@include keyframes(fadeIn) {
			from {
				@include transform(scale(0));
			}
			to {
				@include transform(scale(1));
			}
		}

		@include transform(translateY(50px));
		@include transform-origin(center top);
		@include transform-style(preserve-3d);

	## Transitions define the movement between one state and another.

		@include transition (all 2.0s ease-in-out);
		@include transition (opacity 1.0s ease-in 0s, width 2.0s ease-in 2s);

		@include transition-property (transform);
		@include transition-duration(1.0s);
		@include transition-timing-function(ease-in);
		@include transition-delay(0.5s);
