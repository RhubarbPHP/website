About Rhubarb
=============

Rhubarb is a collection of [open source projects](https://github.com/rhubarbphp) that together comprise the Rhubarb
PHP framework.

Rhubarb is aimed at developers who need to build PHP applications that address the common pitfalls of
enterprise application development:

* Performance degradation as the application grows
* Poorly defined patterns for modular reuse of common application elements

Rhubarb is designed to enable modern development practices, patterns and principles including

* Dependency Injection
* Test driven development
* SOLID principles of software design

## Gcd.

[Gcd.](http://gcdtech.com/) is the originator of the framework and curator and maintainer of the
projects. We use Rhubarb day and daily in demanding and high performance applications and use that experience in shaping the development of Rhubarb.
