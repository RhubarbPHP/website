   	GRID SYSTEM

	Provides various methods used to lay out a page.
	All are based on fractional widths

	@include grid-row();
		// Use on the parent of grid items
	@include grid-row-divs(n);
		// Creates a container for your grid items that ensures flush vertical edges to the outer container, or whatever container it's in.
		// Inserting a number (n) creates equal divisions of that amount
	@include grid-fraction(n, d)
		// A grid fraction. If you want to support old versions of IE, ensure you have an inner container with class .ie-inner
